# Fish Data

This is one of the Mathematical Biology assessed practicals I completed in the first year of my Natural Sciences undergraduate degree.

The practical deals with length and sex data of 30 fish at a study site. My program runs several statistical tests, investigating whether the sex ratio deviates from 1:1 and whether or not male and female length differ.

The tests used include:

- Mean, median, range, IQR
- Binomial test
- Box plot
- T-test
- Mann-Whitney test
